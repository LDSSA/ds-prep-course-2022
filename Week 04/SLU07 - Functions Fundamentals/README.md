# Small Learning Unit 07 - Functions: Fundamentals

## What is in this SLU?

As its topic suggests, in this unit you'll get your first exposure to the most fundamental and powerful tool common to all programming languages: FUNCTIONS! 

You'll be introduced to how these are built but by no means will you become an expert in them and that's okay. It takes years to master the composition of functions in each programming language.


**If there is one takeaway from this LU, it should be:**

### Avoid repeating code by using functions ðŸ§ 

Instead of repeating code every time you need to use it, you should refactor the code into a function and call that function instead. Refactoring consists on improving the structure of the code, while preserving its goal and behaviour - a very important definition for a programmer stack.

The most common and severe mistake that programmers make is to copy-paste the same code into multiple places rather than converting it into a function. It takes a bit of extra brainpower but in the end, it always saves more time than it takes. So let's try and give our best effort in using them!

## How to go through this SLU?
You are probably already familiar with the process but in case you aren't these are the steps for this SLU:

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2022#2-learning-unit-workflow) to set up your environment.
2. Go through the Learning Notebook.
3. Solve the Exercise notebook.
4. Submit the Exercises notebook as described in the Step 5 in [this section](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2022#22---working-on-the-learning-units).

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please check the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2022#4-how-to-ask-for-help), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
