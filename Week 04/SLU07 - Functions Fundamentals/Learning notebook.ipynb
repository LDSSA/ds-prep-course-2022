    "## 1. What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a task, and that you can **reuse** multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword here is \"reuse\" since functions allow you to avoid re-writting (or copy-pasting) the same piece of code in multiple places.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Why is that better than copy-pasting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they provide **modularity**!\n",
    "Let's understand this better with an example: imagine that you have created a calculation that you have copy-pasted into multiple places in your code.\n",
    "In the end, you realise that you were using the wrong formula so you had to change it all over... what a pain, hein? 😓\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have used a function to contain your formula instead, you would just need to fix the bug in the function definition! 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages let us build conceptually unlimited boxes of machinery that do our bidding. It is incredibly empowering. Many tasks that are done on a computer can be automated using machinery, and functions are the most important tool at your disposal to organize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR of why functions are amazing:\n",

    "2. Then they use that input to perform a task\n",

    "* **User-defined functions (UDFs)** - the ones you create!\n",
