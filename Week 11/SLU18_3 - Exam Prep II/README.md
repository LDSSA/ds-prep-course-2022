# SLU18_1 - Exam Prep II

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](https://www.lisbondatascience.org/starters-academy/).

The SLU18_1 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the LDSSA entry exam of the **Batch 3 - Wave 1**.

You can solve the exam just like normal exercise notebooks from the previous SLUs, with the exception that you **should NOT** submit it to the Portal. The score from this notebook is just for your reference on the up-coming entry exam.

It would be adviceable to set some **distraction-free time (~2h)** and do the exercises like if it would be the real entry exam.

Happy coding!
